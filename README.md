# MachineLearning_Project_Abalone
Machine Learning Project on the Abalone Dataset


This code aims to experimenting and comparing results between two traditional Machine Learning models, such as Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, and a more advanced model like the Neural Network. 

The dataset used is the Abalone dataset, with the main goal of predicting the age of the abalone rings based on
different properties such as weight, height, diameter, etc.

The results show that using fewer features for model development yields lower performance, but by normalizing the features, the results improve in some cases. Overall, the Neural Network model outperforms the traditional models. For
regression models, performance measures such as the R-
squared score and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) have
been assessed, while for classification models, the AUC and
accuracy scores were evaluated. The paper suggests not
relying solely on model performance metrics, as this may lead
to overfitting issues.
